1. Dependencies: All the Dart files will share the Flutter SDK dependency. The "pubspec.yaml" file will contain this dependency along with other packages like Dio for network requests, path_provider for file handling, and video_player for playing videos.

2. Exported Variables: The "constants.dart" file will export common variables such as BASE_URL, DOWNLOAD_PATH, etc. These will be shared across "video_downloader.dart", "url_parser.dart", and possibly in screens.

3. Data Schemas: The "video_downloader.dart" and "url_parser.dart" services might share a Video model schema, which could include fields like videoUrl, title, thumbnailUrl, etc.

4. ID Names of DOM Elements: As Flutter uses Widgets instead of DOM, there will be key names for widgets like 'downloadButton', 'videoCard', 'homeScreen', 'downloadScreen' which will be used in testing.

5. Message Names: There might be shared message names for error handling and user notifications like 'downloadError', 'invalidUrl', 'downloadSuccess', etc.

6. Function Names: Shared function names might include 'downloadVideo', 'parseUrl', 'saveFile', etc. These functions will be defined in the services and used in the screens.

7. Shared Widgets: "video_card.dart" and "download_button.dart" will be shared widgets used in both "home_screen.dart" and "download_screen.dart".

8. Android and iOS Specific Configurations: "AndroidManifest.xml" and "Info.plist" will share configurations related to permissions like internet access, file system access, etc.
